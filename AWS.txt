AWS launched 2006

Its collection of remote computing services 
ogether cloud computing 

it's closed to 200 services 

25 regions 

offer ?
availability --> easy to access to anywhere 
scalability --> easy to increase the size ( scaling up and down)
pay as you go --> 


EC2-->Elastic compute cloud 

instance --> launch instances -->  

Webserver

yum install httpd -y

cd /var/www/html

echo "" > index.html

service httpd start

chkcongif httpd on --> automatically started when the machine restarted 

load balancer ( receive the traffic and distribute the traffic)
 receive  the user traffic and distribute the server 
 monitor the healt of the traffice 


Bootstrap script

#!/bin/bash
sudo su 
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html 
echo "Load balance server" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


LOAD Balancer 

Application 
Network
Gateway
classic

response time --> waiting time 
Interval --> health check time interval 
unhealthy threshold --> number of attampts
healthy treshold --> number of attampts

Auto scaling
1.load balancer 
2.auto scalling configuration
3.SNS 
4.auto acaling server limit 
5.cloud watch

system status check --> related to h/w
Instance status check --> related to o/s

2/2 --> both checks are passed
1/2 --> sys - passed, ins --> failed
0/2 --> both checks failed 

scaling up(RAM, CPU, HDD)
increase the h/w verical scaling
increase HDD no need to stop 
RAM and CPU stop and increase 

Horisondal scaling
adding new no of increase
root volume --> os old
EBS volume --> seprate volume

Storage - s3
simplse storage sevice
unlimited storage

versioning
maintain differnt version of object
recover the delete object 
static website hosting
index document (index.html)
error document (error.html)

storage class
default storage class 
standard --> highspeed
Intelligent Tiering
Standard IA (infrequent access)
one zone IA 

cross region replication
Transfer accelaration
enscription
lifecycle management

Load Balancer

To aviod down time
recive the trafic distribure the trafic to server
montor the health 

#!/bin/bash
sudo su

yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "MyGoogle-2" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on

load balancer

Response Timeout--> waiting time to get responce 
Interval --> monitor the health time 
Unhealthy threshold -->
Healthy threshold --> 

Auto scaling

1.loadbalancer --> 
2.Launch configuration --> confgure the instance 
3.SNS --> notification message 
   aaplication integration --> SNS 
   create topic
   add sebscription
4.Auto scaling group --> min max instance config
5.cloudwatch alaram
mangement and governence--> cloud watch alaram
6.auto scaling group attach the alram --> create policy
